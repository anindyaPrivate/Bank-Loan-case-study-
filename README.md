# Bank-Loan-case-study-

With this case study, we hope to demonstrate how to use EDA in a practical corporate setting. In addition to using the EDA module's approaches in this case study, you will get a fundamental grasp of risk analytics in banking and financial services and discover how data is utilized to reduce the risk of losing money when lending to consumers.

Business insight: Lending to individuals is challenging for loan-providing businesses. Because their credit history is weak or nonexistent. Because of this, some customers take advantage of it by defaulting. Imagine you work for a consumer finance firm that specialized in providing urban consumers with several forms of loans. To assess the patterns found in the data, you must utilize EDA. This will prevent applications that can repay the loan from being denied. 

The business must choose a loan after receiving a loan application. Depending on the applicant's profile, approval. The bank's choice is accompanied with two different categories of risks:â€¢ If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, denying the loan results in a loss of business for the firm; however, granting the loan if the applicant is not likely to return the loan, i.e., if he or she is likely to default, may result in a financial loss for the company.
